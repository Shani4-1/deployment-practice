# Dinosaurs Are Cool

Right?

Dinosaurs are **cool**. Which dinosaurs are cool, though? Some cool dinos:

- T-Rex
- Triceratop
- Brachiosaur

But *why* are dinos cool?

1. They're Scary(see any dinosaur movie for an example)
2. They're huge!
3. C'mon, they're dinos!

# Common Code Issues
- Functions will return `undefined` if you don't explicitly return something.

Example:

```js
function add(x, y ) {
    x + y;
}

add(5, 3) //>undefined
```

The same thing in Python for no good reason

```python
def add(x, y):
    x + y

add(5, 4) # undefined    
```
